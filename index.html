        <h2>Problem Statement: Busy Schedule with Confusion</h2>
        <p>
          Students are busy and managing time is important. This is not
          helped by the fact that different professors may use completely 
          different systems for managing classwork and homework. It is 
          confusing when homework for one class is submitted by email while
          another is submitted on Blackboard and another on Dropbox.

          In this diagram, we mapped the major parts of our solution to the problem listed above. Thhe basic idea is a web app that consolidates data from other apps and handle interactions between them. The biggest issue we found was with implementation, the necessary data hooks require work on both ends. The biggest benefit is simplicity and ease of use, which is the main focus of our solution.
