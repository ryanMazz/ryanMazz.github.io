        <h2>Problem Statement: The Vision</h2>
        <p>
          Students are busy and managing time is important. This is not
          helped by the fact that different professors may use completely 
          different systems for managing classwork and homework. It is 
          confusing when homework for one class is submitted by email while
          another is submitted on Blackboard and another on Dropbox.

        <p>
          In this diagram, we mapped the major parts of our solution to the 
          problem listed above. The basic idea is a web app that consolidates 
          data from other apps and handle interactions between them. The biggest 
          issue we found was with implementation, the necessary data hooks 
          require work on both ends. The biggest benefit is simplicity and ease 
          of use, which is the main focus of our solution.

        <p>
          We envisioned some scenarios where our projected users interact with
          our service, showing the benefits of convience that it gives. Our users
          will have peace of mind knowing everything can be seem at a glace and 
          managed all in one place.

          Some basic ideas for how our product will look. My teammates focused on a
