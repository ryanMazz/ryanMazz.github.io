        <h2>Careers</h2>
        <p>
            Software Engineering is the industry involved with the creation and maintenence
            of software. The positions within this industry are vast, covering various
            differet applications and styles of work. Personally, I would like to become an
            API developer, as I love the idea of making multiple different platforms work
            together.
        </p>

        <h2>Ethics</h2>
        <p>
            Due to the wide array of careers in this industry, ethical concerns are plentiful.
            Take for example a postion to develop software intended for nonconsensual survaillence. 
            Those developers may not be aware that the software they are creating may be used in
            such a manner, but yet, they are responsible for it's creation. Then who should be
            responsible for the invasion of privacy, the ones who created the software, or the ones
            who ordered it's creation?
        </p>

        <h2>Values</h2>
        <p>
            My core values of loyalty, ethics, intelligence, and patience are more personal values
            than professional. However, I believe that those who abide by these values are less
            likely to find themselves involved in ethical dilemmas such as the one described above.
            My response as a developer would be to reject the job if I was aware my software would be
            used for such a purpose, or renounce the company if I was decieved into creating that
            software without knowing it's true purpose.
        </p>

        <h2>Cybersecurity</h2>
        <p>
            Software Engineering is the basis of all cybersecurity. Software developers create the tools
            which others use to defend themselves against cyberattacks. However, the most prevelant issu
            in this industry would be backdoors, or secret bits of code inserted into a project that make
            hacking it much easier. This is a common way many large cyberattacks have been executed. To 
            prevent this, it is good practice to have multiple developers review all code before it is added
            to the project to ensure no backdoors are created.
